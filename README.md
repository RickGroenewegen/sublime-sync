# sublime-sync

A command-line watcher / sync tool for the Sublime SFTP plugin (https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp). 

The problem with the Sublime SFTP plugin is that if files are modified externally it does not synchronize them. This module does the same as the SFTP plugin setting and also monitors recursively for external changes (Git pulls, build tools etc).

If changes are detected the files are automatically synchronized with your remote SFTP directory. It still uses your SFTP server settings / credentials from sftp-config.json and respects the ignore rules set in 'ignore_regexes'.

If no sftp-config.json was found the user will be prompted to enter host / credential information. sublime-sync will then create a sftp-config.json manually. When using OS X the password will be stored in the keychain instead of sftp-config.json

## Installation
Install with npm for Node.js. sublime-sync requires [sshpass](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/noninteractive-shell-script-ssh-password-provider) to allow password verification without a command prompt.

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadwanev/bigboybrew/master/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb
npm install sublime-sync -g
```

## Usage
 
You can start the watcher by going to the directory you want to watch and call 'sublime-sync':

```
cd ~/myDir
sublime-sync
```

## SSH keys

Using SSH keys is supported by configuring the path to the PEM file in your sftp-config.json:

```
"sftp_flags": ["-o IdentityFile=/path/to/your.pem"],
```
